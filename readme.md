# stDLNN

## Introduction
This repository contains the algorithm for the research paper titled "Parallel non-Cartesian spatial-temporal dictionary learning neural networks (stDLNN) for accelerating 4D-MRI", published in Medical Image Analysis (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2022.102701) .

This paper presents a novel framework that combines dictionary learning with deep learning algorithms to accelerate dynamic MRI. The proposed stDLNN framework utilizes spatial-temporal prior information of dynamic MRI data to achieve better reconstruction quality. This work also strives to improve inference speed and reduce GPU memory usage during training.
